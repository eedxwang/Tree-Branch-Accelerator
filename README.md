Accompanying a paper on on-chip laser coupling for dielectric laser accelerator structures.

Link to paper will be here, as well as citation information.

The main codebase is in simulation.m  This defines the simulation class, which has properties of parameters and methods corresponding to solving different quantities.

Simple examples are in simple_examples.m to get to know how the code works and solve some simple examples.
