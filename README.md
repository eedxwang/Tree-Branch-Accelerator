# DLA-Laser-Coupling-Simulation-Software


## Paper information
Accompanying a paper on on-chip laser coupling for dielectric laser accelerator structures.  Right now it is an arXiv preprint.

[ArXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04441 "ArXiv preprint")

## How to run simulation
The main codebase is in "simulation.m"  This defines the simulation class, which holds both the properties of parameters and methods corresponding to solving the laser coupling system.

Simple examples are in the appropriately named "simple_examples.m", which will help new users get to know how the code works and solve some simple examples.

For documentation, type:

        doc simulation

in the matlab command line once the directory is added to path
